## Dynamic Programming types of problems:
- Combinatoric problems
- Optimization problems
- Problems that ask if something is possible or not
## Framework for solving dynamic programming problems:
- Define the object function
- Identify base cases
- Write down a recurrence relation for the optimized objective function
- What's the order of execution?
- Where to look for the answer?
